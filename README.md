# VendingMachine

CLI application written in Java using OOP principals. Inventory was provided as a pipe delimited text file and was read into the machine using Scanner. The applicatation prompts the user to select from a menu allowing selections such as show items, deposit money, select items to purchase. The application closes the transaction at the buyers request and provdes the items and change due to the user. 

This was our first capstone project over a few days with my partner at Tech Elevator. Being our first project in which we were given MVP requirements and a blank slate, the project proved to be both a challenging and rewarding learning experience.
